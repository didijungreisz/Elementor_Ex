I used sqllite as a db and flask framework for the api points, to make it as much easy as possible to install and use.
(for more complex use cases I'll probably use mongoDB. it is the preferable choice here.)
I created 2 api points to get all the url list data and to ask for one single url data.

In AWS I'll implement it with container and use use AWS db
